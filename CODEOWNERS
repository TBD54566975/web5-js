# This CODEOWNERS file denotes the project leads
# and encodes their responsibilities for code review.

# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# The format is described: https://github.blog/2017-07-06-introducing-code-owners/

# These owners will be the default owners for all directories in the repo that do not have a designated owner.
* @frankhinek @csuwildcat @mistermoe @thehenrytsai @lirancohen @shamilovtim

# These are owners who can approve folders under the root directory and other CICD and QoL directories.
# Should be the union list of all owners of sub-directories, optionally minus the default owners.
