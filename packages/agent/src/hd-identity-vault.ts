/**
 * The `HdIdentityVault` class provides secure storage and management of identity data.
 *
 * The `HdIdentityVault` class implements the `IdentityVault` interface, providing secure storage
 * and management of identity data with an added layer of security using Hierarchical Deterministic
 * (HD) key derivation based on the SLIP-0010 standard for Ed25519 keys. It enhances identity
 * protection by generating and securing the identity using a derived HD key, allowing for the
 * deterministic regeneration of keys from a recovery phrase.
 *
 * The vault is capable of:
 * - Secure initialization with a password and an optional recovery phrase, employing HD key
 *   derivation.
 * - Encrypting the identity data using a derived content encryption key (CEK) which is securely
 *   encrypted and stored, accessible only by the correct password.
 * - Securely backing up and restoring the vaultâ€™s contents, including the HD-derived keys and
 *   associated DID.
 * - Locking and unlocking the vault, which encrypts and decrypts the CEK for secure access to the
 *   vault's contents.
 * - Managing the DID associated with the identity, providing a secure identity layer for
 *   applications.
 *
 * Usage involves initializing the vault with a secure password (and optionally a recovery phrase),
 * which then allows for the secure storage, backup, and retrieval of the identity data.
 *
 * Note: Ensure the password is strong and securely managed, as it is crucial for the security of the
 * vault's encrypted contents.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const vault = new HdIdentityVault();
 * await vault.initialize({ password: 'secure-unique-phrase', recoveryPhrase: 'twelve words ...' });
 * const backup = await vault.backup();
 * await vault.restore({ backup, password: 'secure-unique-phrase' });
