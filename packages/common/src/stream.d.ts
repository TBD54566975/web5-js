    /**
     * Checks if the provided Web `ReadableStream` is in a readable state.
     *
     * After verifying that the stream is a Web {@link https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/#rs-model | ReadableStream},
     * this method checks the {@link https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/#readablestream-locked | locked}
     * property of the ReadableStream. The `locked` property is `true` if a reader is currently
     * active, meaning the stream is either being read or has already been read (and hence is not in a
     * readable state). If `locked` is `false`, it means the stream is still in a state where it can
     * be read.
     *
     * In the case where a `ReadableStream` has been unlocked but is no longer readable (for example,
     * if it has been fully read or cancelled), additional checks are needed beyond just examining the
     * locked property. The ReadableStream API does not provide a direct way to check if the stream
     * has data left or if it's in a readable state once it's been unlocked.
     *
     * Per {@link https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/#other-specs-rs-introspect | WHATWG Streams, Section 9.1.3. Introspection}:
     *
     * > ...note that apart from checking whether or not the stream is locked, this direct
     * > introspection is not possible via the public JavaScript API, and so specifications should
     * > instead use the algorithms in ยง9.1.2 Reading. (For example, instead of testing if the stream
     * > is readable, attempt to get a reader and handle any exception.)
     *
     * This implementation employs the technique suggested by the WHATWG Streams standard by
     * attempting to acquire a reader and checking the state of the reader. If acquiring a reader
     * succeeds, it immediately releases the lock and returns `true`, indicating the stream is
     * readable. If an error occurs while trying to get a reader (which can happen if the stream is
     * already closed or errored), it catches the error and returns `false`, indicating the stream is
     * not readable.
     *
     * @example
     * ```ts
     * const readableStream = new ReadableStream({ ... });
     * const isStreamReadable = Stream.isReadable({ readableStream });
     * console.log(isStreamReadable); // Output: true or false
     * ```
     *
     * @remarks
     * - This method does not check whether the stream has data left to read; it only checks if the
     *   stream is in a state that allows reading. It is possible for a stream to be unlocked but
     *   still have no data left if it has never been locked to a reader.
     *
     * @param readableStream - The Web `ReadableStream` to be checked for readability.
     *
