   * extracts both public and private keys from the DID's key manager and organizes them into a

   * @remarks
   * If the DID's key manager does not allow private keys to be exported, the `PortableDid` returned
   * will not contain a `privateKeys` property. This enables the importing and exporting DIDs that
   * use the same underlying KMS even if the KMS does not support exporting private keys. Examples
   * include hardware security modules (HSMs) and cloud-based KMS services like AWS KMS.
   *
   * If the DID's key manager does support exporting private keys, the resulting `PortableDid` will
   * include a `privateKeys` property which contains the same number of entries as there are
   * verification methods as the DID document, each with its associated private key and the
   * purpose(s) for which the key can be used (e.g., `authentication`, `assertionMethod`, etc.).

   * @example
   * ```ts
   * // Assuming `did` is an instance of BearerDid
   * const portableDid = await did.export();
   * // portableDid now contains the DID URI, document, metadata, and optionally, private keys.
   * ```
