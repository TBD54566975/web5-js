/**
 * Defines the set of options available when creating a new Decentralized Identifier (DID) with the
 * 'did:jwk' method.
 *
 * Either the `algorithm` or `verificationMethods` option can be specified, but not both.
 * - A new key will be generated using the algorithm identifier specified in either the `algorithm`
 *   property or the `verificationMethods` object's `algorithm` property.
 * - If `verificationMethods` is given, it must contain exactly one entry since DID JWK only
 *   supports a single verification method.
 * - If neither is given, the default is to generate a new Ed25519 key.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // DID Creation
 *
 * // By default, when no options are given, a new Ed25519 key will be generated.
 * const did = await DidJwk.create();
 *
 * // The algorithm to use for key generation can be specified as a top-level option.
 * const did = await DidJwk.create({
 *   options: { algorithm = 'ES256K' }
 * });
 *
 * // Or, alternatively as a property of the verification method.
 * const did = await DidJwk.create({
 *   options: {
 *     verificationMethods: [{ algorithm = 'ES256K' }]
 *   }
 * });
 *
 * // DID Creation with a KMS
 * const keyManager = new LocalKeyManager();
 * const did = await DidJwk.create({ keyManager });
 *
 * // DID Resolution
 * const resolutionResult = await DidJwk.resolve({ did: did.uri });
 *
 * // Signature Operations
 * const signer = await did.getSigner();
 * const signature = await signer.sign({ data: new TextEncoder().encode('Message') });
 * const isValid = await signer.verify({ data: new TextEncoder().encode('Message'), signature });
 *
 * // Import / Export
 *
 * // Export a BearerDid object to the PortableDid format.
 * const portableDid = await did.export();
 *
 * // Reconstruct a BearerDid object from a PortableDid
 * const did = await DidJwk.import(portableDid);
 * ```

/**
 * The `DidJwk` class provides an implementation of the `did:jwk` DID method.
 *
 * Features:
 * - DID Creation: Create new `did:jwk` DIDs.
 * - DID Key Management: Instantiate a DID object from an existing verification method key set or
 *                       or a key in a Key Management System (KMS). If supported by the KMS, a DID's
 *                       key can be exported to a portable DID format.
 * - DID Resolution: Resolve a `did:jwk` to its corresponding DID Document.
 * - Signature Operations: Sign and verify messages using keys associated with a DID.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The `did:jwk` DID method uses a single JSON Web Key (JWK) to generate a DID and does not rely
 * on any external system such as a blockchain or centralized database. This characteristic makes
 * it suitable for use cases where a assertions about a DID Subject can be self-verifiable by
 * third parties.
 *
 * The DID URI is formed by Base64URL-encoding the JWK and prefixing with `did:jwk:`. The DID
 * Document of a `did:jwk` DID contains a single verification method, which is the JWK used
 * to generate the DID. The verification method is identified by the key ID `#0`.
 *
 * @see {@link https://github.com/quartzjer/did-jwk/blob/main/spec.md | DID JWK Specification}
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // DID Creation
 * const did = await DidJwk.create();
 *
 * // DID Creation with a KMS
 * const keyManager = new LocalKeyManager();
 * const did = await DidJwk.create({ keyManager });
 *
 * // DID Resolution
 * const resolutionResult = await DidJwk.resolve({ did: did.uri });
 *
 * // Signature Operations
 * const signer = await did.getSigner();
 * const signature = await signer.sign({ data: new TextEncoder().encode('Message') });
 * const isValid = await signer.verify({ data: new TextEncoder().encode('Message'), signature });
 *
 * // Key Management
 *
 * // Instantiate a DID object from an existing key in a KMS
 * const did = await DidJwk.fromKeyManager({
 *  didUri: 'did:jwk:eyJrIjoiT0tQIiwidCI6IkV1c2UyNTYifQ',
 *  keyManager
 * });
 *
 * // Instantiate a DID object from an existing verification method key
 * const did = await DidJwk.fromKeys({
 *   verificationMethods: [{
 *     publicKeyJwk: {
 *       kty: 'OKP',
 *       crv: 'Ed25519',
 *       x: 'cHs7YMLQ3gCWjkacMURBsnEJBcEsvlsE5DfnsfTNDP4'
