/**
 * The `DidWeb` class provides an implementation of the `did:web` DID method.
 *
 * Features:
 * - DID Resolution: Resolve a `did:web` to its corresponding DID Document.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The `did:web` method uses a web domain's existing reputation and aims to integrate decentralized
 * identities with the existing web infrastructure to drive adoption. It leverages familiar web
 * security models and domain ownership to provide accessible, interoperable digital identity
 * management.
 *
 * @see {@link https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/ | DID Web Specification}
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // DID Resolution
 * const resolutionResult = await DidWeb.resolve({ did: did.uri });
 * ```
