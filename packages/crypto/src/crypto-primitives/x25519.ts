/**
 * The `X25519` class provides a comprehensive suite of utilities for working with the X25519
 * elliptic curve, widely used for key agreement protocols and cryptographic applications. It
 * provides methods for key generation, conversion, and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)
 * key agreement,  all aligned with standard cryptographic practices.
 *
 * The class supports conversions between raw byte formats and JSON Web Key (JWK) formats,
 * making it versatile for various cryptographic tasks. It adheres to RFC6090 for ECDH, ensuring
 * secure and effective handling of keys and cryptographic operations.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Key Generation: Generate X25519 private keys in JWK format.
 * - Key Conversion: Transform keys between raw byte arrays and JWK formats.
 * - Public Key Derivation: Derive public keys from private keys.
 * - ECDH Shared Secret Computation: Securely derive shared secrets using private and public keys.
 *
 * The methods in this class are asynchronous, returning Promises to accommodate various
 * JavaScript environments.
 *
 * Usage Examples:
 *
 * ```ts
 * // Key Generation
 * const privateKey = await X25519.generateKey();
 *
 * // Public Key Derivation
 * const publicKey = await X25519.computePublicKey({ privateKey });
 *
 * // ECDH Shared Secret Computation
 * const sharedSecret = await X25519.sharedSecret({
 *   privateKeyA: privateKey,
 *   publicKeyB: anotherPublicKey
 * });
 *
 * // Key Conversion
 * const publicKeyBytes = await X25519.publicKeyToBytes({ publicKey });
 * const privateKeyBytes = await X25519.privateKeyToBytes({ privateKey });
 * ```

   *
   * This method facilitates the ECDH key agreement protocol, which is a method of securely
   * deriving a shared secret between two parties based on their private and public keys.
   * It takes the private key of one party (privateKeyA) and the public key of another
   * party (publicKeyB) to compute a shared secret. The shared secret is derived from the
   * x-coordinate of the elliptic curve point resulting from the multiplication of the
   * public key with the private key.
   *
   * Note: When performing Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement,
   * the resulting shared secret is a point on the elliptic curve, which
   * consists of an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate. With a 256-bit curve like
   * secp256k1, each of these coordinates is 32 bytes (256 bits) long. However,
   * in the ECDH process, it's standard practice to use only the x-coordinate
   * of the shared secret point as the resulting shared key. This is because
   * the y-coordinate does not add to the entropy of the key, and both parties
   * can independently compute the x-coordinate.  Consquently, this implementation
