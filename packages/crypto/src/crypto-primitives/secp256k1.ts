 * making it versatile for various cryptographic tasks. It adheres to RFC6090 for ECDH and
 * RFC6979 for ECDSA signing and verification, ensuring compatibility and security.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Key Generation: Generate secp256k1 private keys in JWK format.
 * - Key Conversion: Transform keys between raw byte arrays and JWK formats.
 * - Public Key Derivation: Derive public keys from private keys.
 * - ECDH Shared Secret Computation: Securely derive shared secrets using private and public keys.
 * - ECDSA Signing and Verification: Sign data and verify signatures with secp256k1 keys.
 * - Key Validation: Validate the mathematical correctness of secp256k1 keys.
 *
 * The methods in this class are asynchronous, returning Promises to accommodate various
 * JavaScript environments.

   * it's a private or a public key. For a private key, the method first computes the
   * corresponding public key and then extracts the x and y coordinates. For a public key,
   * it directly returns these coordinates. The coordinates are represented as Uint8Array.
   *
   * The x and y coordinates represent the key's position on the elliptic curve and can be
   * used in various cryptographic operations, such as digital signatures or key agreement
   * protocols.
   *
   * Example usage:
   *
   * ```ts
   * // For a private key
   * const privateKey = new Uint8Array([...]); // A 32-byte private key
   * const { x: xFromPrivateKey, y: yFromPrivateKey } = await Secp256k1.getCurvePoints({ key: privateKey });
   *
   * // For a public key
   * const publicKey = new Uint8Array([...]); // A 33-byte or 65-byte public key
   * const { x: xFromPublicKey, y: yFromPublicKey } = await Secp256k1.getCurvePoints({ key: publicKey });
   * ```
   *
   * @param options - The options for the operation.
   * @param options.key - The key for which to get the elliptic curve points.
   *                      Can be either a private key or a public key.
   *                      The key should be passed as a Uint8Array.
   *
   * @returns A Promise that resolves to an object with properties 'x' and 'y',
   *          each being a Uint8Array representing the x and y coordinates of the key point on the
   *          elliptic curve.
